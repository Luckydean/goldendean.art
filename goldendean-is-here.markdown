Goldendean is a genderqueer trans media artist provoking dialogue about the gaze, queer bodies, love and social justice. A.K.A. Dean Hutton, they have worked across photojournalism, print, digital, video and social media, performance and community action since the late 1990s. Their strategy of simple,  often improvised actions by a “Fat Queer White Trans body” share moments of soft courage to affirm the right of all bodies to exist, to be celebrated and protected.
